# Talking Tape Dispenser

If you'd like to build your own tape dispenser, which tells you how much you've used, and blesses you afterwards, you have two choices.

1. Leave out a pencil and paper one night before bed, and hope that by the morning God will have written down the instructions.
2. Buy one from me. Maybe? Details coming soon(?)
3. Clone this repo, buy the required parts, a 3D printer, and get to work.

## License 
Feel free to make/reuse/modify this project for personal use. In the unlikely event that you're planning to spin up a large-scale production line to make thousands of these, I'd really recommend doing a few more revisions on the code and the models. In which case, I'm available at a very reasonable rate.
